# portfolio-page
A personal portfolio is a document where you can put the qualitative and quantative information about your skills and knowledge regarding your project.
I created this project to use my html, and css skills as I learnt during my bootcamp journey.
I used google to researh different html elements and css features."https://www.w3schools.com/html/"
Tutoring and TAs helped me to understand more about how to start my portfolio page."https://us04web.zoom.us/j/74449938475?pwd=TUEyeEJ6YWhCaWVvRzlNZWdqdHFIZz09#success"
